Question 2:-

Part 1:- Building logistic regression from bid dataset( in short)

1. Target variable
  win( 1 if bid won , 0 otherwise)
2. Feature selection 
   bid_amount - this is choosen becoz higher bids are more likely to win
   time_to_bid - low response time helps for better chances of winning
   ad_unit - 
  browser_name / os_name - how the ads served , might affect
  size - ad size

3. Preprocessing
   1. encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding
   2. Handling missing data
   3. Normalizing the numerical features

4. Train/ Test split  - we can split the data by 80/20


Part 2:


1. bid_amount(0.8) - by increasing 1 unit in bid amount , winning increase by 0.8 
 so, higher the bid , higher will be the chance of winning

2. time_to_bid(-0.4)
  by increasing 1 unit , winning decrease by 0.4
  so , slower response , lower chance of winning

3. ad_unit_A(0.3)
   by using ad_unit_A increases by 0.3
  so , ad_unit_A is better than ad_unit_B
